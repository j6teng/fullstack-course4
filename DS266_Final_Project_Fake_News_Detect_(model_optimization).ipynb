Although the meeting was praised by many prison reform advocates, Kardashian's family was reportedly \\\"furious\\\" about the meeting, with some calling her a \\\"traitor\\\" for associating with the controversial president.\\n\\nAccording to an inside source, Kardashian's family was particularly upset about the fact that she did not consult with them before the meeting and that they only found out about it through the media. \\\"They feel like she's turned her back on them and on their values,\\\" the source said. \\\"They don't understand why she would align herself with someone like Trump, who they consider to be a racist and a misogynist.\\\"\\n\\nDespite the backlash, Kardashian defended her decision to meet with Trump, arguing that her position as a celebrity gives her a unique platform to advocate for change. \\\"I know that some people might not agree with me, but I think it's important to have conversations with people on both sides of the aisle,\\\" she said. \\\"We need to come together and find common ground if we want to make real progress.\\\"\\n\\nKardashian's meeting with Trump has already produced some positive outcomes. Earlier this month, President Trump commuted the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a first-time nonviolent drug offender whose case Kardashian had championed. Many are now hoping that Kardashian will use her influence to advocate for more criminal justice reforms in the future. However, it remains to be seen whether her family will ever come around to supporting her controversial political views.\",\n          \"Paige denies being suspended for taking PEDs and says she passed all the tests but failed to do it in the allocated time\\n\\nWWE star Paige reveals reason behind 60-day suspension and says 'I don't do drugs' as she looks to get career back on track\\n\\nWWE star Paige has revealed the real reason she was hit with a 60-day suspension and says 'I don't do drugs'.\\n\\nThe British wrestling diva was issued with a lengthy ban back in October for her second violation of the wrestling company's Talent Wellness Programme.\\n\\nPaige had already been suspended back in August for 30 days and had previously denied taking illegal substances.\\n\\nBut the 24-year-old has now opened up about the heartache surrounding her suspension after being filmed on reality show Total Divas.\\n\\nAccording to The Sun, the interview was conducted last year when Paige had just found out the news that she had been banned and broke down in tears.\\n\\nPaige said: \\u201cWWE posted a statement about me failing the wellness policy.\\n\\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel Play now\\n\\n\\u201cWe get drug tested all the time\\u2026first of all, I don\\u2019t do drugs.\\n\\n\\u201cSecond of all, I did the test and I passed it.

I cried because I was so happy for her that she was free.\\\"\\n\\nHe says his mother opened up to him about eight months ago, when 4:44 was in production.\\n\\n\\\"Like, she just told me. I made the song the next day,\\\" he reveals. \\\"I knew. But this was the first time we had the conversation. And the first time I heard her say she loved her partner. Like, 'I feel like I love somebody.' She said, 'I feel like.' She held that little bit back, still. She didn't say, 'I'm in love.' She said, 'I feel like I love someone.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And I just, I cried,\\\" he adds. \\\"I don't even believe in crying because you're happy. I don't even know what that is. What is that?\\\"\\n\\nJAY-Z continued on, asking Letterman to imagine having lived your entire life for someone else, and the protection of your children.\\n\\n\\\"For my mother to have to live as someone that she wasn't and hide and, like, protect her kids -- and didn't want to embarrass her kids, and you know, for all this time,\\\" he says. \\\"For her to sit in front of me and tell me, 'I think I love someone.' I mean, I really cried.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Smile\\\" was released late last June, and marked the first time JAY-Z and Gloria ever addressed her sexual identity. Approximately 40 seconds into the track, the third off 4:44, JAY-Z sings, \\\"Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian, had to pretend so long that she's a thespian. Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate. Society shame and the pain was too much to take. Cried tears of joy when you fell in love. Don't matter to me if it's a him or her. I just want to see you smile through all the hate.\\\"\\n\\nGloria joined her son with a spoken outro, saying, \\\"Living in the shadow. Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live? In the shadows people see you as happy and free, because that's what you want them to see. Living two lives, happy, but not free.\\\"\\n\\nMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman: Jay-Z launches globally on Netflix Friday, April 6.
